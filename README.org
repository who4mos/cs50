* CS50's problem sets

This repository contain my solutions to [[https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/][CS50]]'s problem sets.


* Requirements

To run the codes you'll need [[https://github.com/cs50/libcs50][libcs50]].

* Notes

In week 4 the images folder for the filters psets are missing on purpose, the only important file is ~helpers.c~ in both filter-less and filter-more.
